# Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial initial step in understanding a terrorism dataset. 

1. **Data Loading**: Begin by importing your dataset, typically in a tabular format (e.g., CSV), using libraries like pandas in Python.

2. **Data Exploration**: Start by examining the dataset's basic properties. Check for the number of rows, columns, data types, and missing values.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Ensure data consistency and integrity.

4. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate basic statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for numeric columns to gain an initial understanding of the data's central tendencies and variability.

5. **Data Visualization**: Create various visualizations, including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.

6. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to extract meaningful information.

7. **Domain Knowledge**: Incorporate domain knowledge to interpret findings and identify potential research questions.

8. **Hypothesis Testing**: Formulate hypotheses and conduct statistical tests to validate or reject them.

9. **Time Series Analysis**: If applicable, explore time-dependent trends and seasonality in the data.

10. **Summary and Insights**: Summarize key findings, insights, and potential areas for further analysis.

EDA helps researchers and analysts uncover patterns and trends, which can guide more focused and in-depth analyses.
